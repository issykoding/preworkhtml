    <h1>The mystery behind Tupac's life after Death:</h1>

    <p>Tupac was born June 16, 1971 â€“ and died September 13, 1996. Me Against the world , All Eyes on Me and Makaveli the Don Killumiti are some of his most popular albums. 
      The album makaveli was completely finished in seven days, The lyrics were written and recorded in only three days and mixing took an additional four days.
      These are the last songs Shakur recorded before he was shot on September 7, 1996. He was shot on September
      7th; and survived on the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and"died" the 13th. Hence the title The 7 Day Theory. 
      Tupac's album All Eyes on Me was released on Feb.13, 1996. Tupac "died" on Sept.13, 1996. 
      It is quite a coincidence that the two dates are exactly 7 months apart, leading some people to believe he faked his death and still lives on.
      Noboby was ever charged for his death but conspiracies about the Illuminati , an 18th-century Bavarian secret society known for its anti-totalitarian and anti-religious activities 
      might have been behind it. The Don Kill-Illuminati tupac Amaru Shakur left clues behind about who he might have thought killed him. 
      We just need to read between the lines...
